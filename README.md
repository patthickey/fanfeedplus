This site was built to practice with MySQL and databases.
It still needs a facelife, but the backend was more important.
Users of the Star Wars Card Trader app can join the site and add cards to their haves/wants/trading list,
then they are able to use thoses list to find users who have/want/are trading similiar so people can set up fair trades.
There is also the abilitiy to add cards to the database so it will stay current that is meant to be for administators only.
With this project I also learned about sessions and practied javscript.
